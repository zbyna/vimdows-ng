vimdows-ng navigation

---------------------



### Info

Vimdows-ng allows you to use Vim (or vim-like) normal mode outside anywhere in Windows.



Use the provided executable or the .ahk script with [Autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com). It does not require any special permissions and will run in your system notification area until activated, when it'll show an icon on your taskbar and a small tooltip overlay in the top-left corner of the screen.



This is forked from [achalddave](https://github.com/achalddave/Vimdows-Navigation) who himself modified the

[original script](http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=44762)

by Rich Alesi, and most of the credit for this script goes to him.



### Activate normal mode

- with <tt>Shift-Esc</tt>

- with <tt>Esc</tt> for selected programs:

	* Matlab

	* Thunderbird Text Composition

- with <tt>Capslock</tt> for CodeTyphon



### Basic VIM navigation and text manipulation

If you are not familiar with VIM yet, you might want to try a [vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/). A good in-depth book is [Practical VIM](https://pragprog.com/book/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition).

### More modifications in this fork:

- Change-mode, change-inner, delete-inner modes.

- show tooltip "Vimdows" when active (useful when hiding task bar)

- correction of indent and undo

- provide another script to remap caps to esc.

- limit of 50 to not blindly execute a repeated command too often (e.g. 500w -> 50w)



### Application-specific modifications:

#### Matlab:

- Proper indent using editor indenting.



### Todo:

- f _char_ should move to next occurence of _char_

- jump between block beginning/end (in vim, % jumps between { and }, for instance)?
